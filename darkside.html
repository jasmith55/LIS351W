		<h2>Why The Album Is Important</h2>

		<p>This album is one of the most iconic and best-selling albums of all time. Its combination of rock music and progressive elements makes it refreshing compared to the more straightforward rock albums of the time. It is also one of the few albums to have all songs lead into one another, making it feel more like an experience rather than a collection of individual songs. I'd always recognized this album cover growing up but didn't have the chance to listen to it until when I was around 13. It's a fantastic album and makes wise comments on society and our role as humans.</p>
