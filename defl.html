		<h2>The Band:</h2>

		<h2>Why The Album Is Important</h2>

		<p>This album is important because it combined heavy instrumentals with pop hooks and helped kickstart the glam metal genre. This genre was very popular in the 80's with bands like Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, and Guns N' Roses. Personally, I enjoy this album more than the later Def Leppard albums because of its more raw and heavy sound.
