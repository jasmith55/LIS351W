		<h2>Why The Album Is Important</h2>

		<p>This album is important because it popularized the use of twin-guitar harmonies and the song lyrics had great storytelling. This storytelling is clearly evident in songs like "Cowboy Song", detailing the story of a cowboy traveling through to the US. I've always been fond of "The Boys Are Back In Town" since I was a kid, and after hearing the rest of the album it certainly matches up.</p>
